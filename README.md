# googlooper
Audio and video looper for files stored on Google Drive

This was originally developed to aid musicians like myself in learning and rehearsing music. However, I am excited to use this tool to loop sections of both audio and video files as part of a creative process where I deconstruct and reprocess the original source material to create new artwork. I hope you find interesting ways to use it as well. Please enjoy!

How to Use
---
Point your web browser to [https://octopus-arts.github.io/googlooper](https://octovolt.github.io/googlooper).

To load a file into googlooper, you first need to get a shareable link to the file. On Google Drive, you can right-click on the file you want to load and see a contextual menu appear. Within this contextual menu, select ***Share***. A dialog will appear, and then you can click on ***Copy Link*** in the lower left corner. Paste this link into a text document. Then you want to copy the file id from the link and paste it into googlooper. For example, in the following link:

```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1et2nM9a1eq5WgRbomOMw7S_z6L8_9kcm/view?usp=sharing
```

the file ID is

```
1et2nM9a1eq5WgRbomOMw7S_z6L8_9kcm
``` 

Future Improvements
---
I am hopeful that this tool can grow over time to become more user-friendly and to handle the looping of audio and video across a wide range of browsers. Pull requests that push the tool in this direction would be highly appreciated.

In particular, the following issues need to be addressed as soon as possible:

* The files do not play on Mobile Safari. This needs to be fixed.
* It is somewhat difficult to get a shareable link, copy the file ID out of it, and then paste it into the Googlooper. Ideally, the tool would provide a file browser to help the user pick out which file to use.
* While I like the stark visual aesthetic, it could be improved. The buttons don't match the height of the input fields on all browsers, for example.

Alas, my time is not infinite, so these improvements have not yet occurred. Please send a pull request if you feel inspired to do so.
